CODAZEN SOFTWARE ENGINEERING ASSIGNMENT

Time complexity –

O(n1*n2)-
Here, n1 = size of course1 Student array
n2= size of course2 Student array

Space complexity –

Space complexity of the algorithm would be O(1), as space required to compare course arrays
would be dependent on array size and will not increase, it would be constant.



HOURS WORKED ON THE ASSIGNMENT-

- I worked around 5 hours on the assignment.

Thank you.
